# Web-Text-to-PDF-Chrome-Extension
This project demonstrates how to create a Chrome extension that converts the text content of a webpage into a downloadable PDF file. It integrates with a Node.js backend to handle the PDF generation process. Users can easily convert the entire webpage's text or selected text into a PDF with just a right-click or selection.
